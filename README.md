### NLP Lab 

This lab is based on a tutorial for the responsibly Python package.  The original tutorial does not appear to be posted, but a similar demo is available at the responsibly website here: https://docs.responsibly.ai/notebooks/demo-word-embedding-bias.html

#### Logistics

To complete the assignment, please make sure you have the entire `nlp_assignment` folder. The folder includes images which will load into your notebook and aid in your understanding. The easiest way to do this is to clone or download the entire repository.

#### Setup

On a mac, open a terminal window.

Make a conda environment with strictly less than Python 3.8 but greater than or equal to Python 3.6

> conda create -n py37 python=3.7 anaconda

> conda activate py37

Install numpy and matplotlib (v2.2.3) through conda
conda install numpy

> conda install matplotlib=2.2.3

> pip install responsibly

On a mac you then load Jupyter Notebook by typing the command below. The ampersand is to run the notebook in the "background", that is to allow you to continue typing other commands in the same terminal window.

> jupyter-notebook&

#### Lab completion and submission

You will be working in a Python notebook. You should be able to include both your written responses and code in this file. **When you submit on Canvas, submit only the notebook, with your last name added to the file name as follows: `nlp_assignment_lastname.ipynb`.** If you feel the need to include other files or are otherwise having any trouble with this, please feel free to ask questions on Piazza.
